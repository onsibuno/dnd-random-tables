# 🧙 Dungeons & Dragons Random Tables Generator 🐉


playing dnd as a dungeon master I love **random tables** as a way to workshop a bunch of paths in the players adventures, and for *their dices to select one* .
Until now I've been using spreadsheets softwares to make my own tables, and they can be enough for plain text usage.
But this project idea is to facilitate making a new one, have a way to highlight the selected event and have stats be readily available for monsters, items and other dnd sheanigans.


As part of my web development training I've decided to use **Symfony** for this projet.
